## Generate Procurement Synthetic Data

**Context & Goal**

You're creating the entire procurement dataset that will power cross-domain queries in HelixGraph. This isn't just random data generation. You're modeling real-world business relationships between suppliers, purchase orders, and invoices. Think of yourself as simulating a company's procurement department over the past year.

**Detailed Requirements:**

**Part 1: Supplier Generation**

You need to create 150 suppliers that feel like real companies. Consider:

**Attributes to Generate:**

* `id`: Unique identifier (format: `SUP_001` to `SUP_150`)
* `name`: Company name (realistic, not "Supplier A")
* `category`: Business type (IT Services, Marketing Agency, Office Supplies, Logistics, Consulting, Manufacturing)
* `risk_score`: Integer 0-100 representing reliability/risk
* `country`: Where they're based (mix of domestic and international)
* `payment_terms`: Net 30, Net 60, Net 90 (days until payment due)
* `annual_revenue`: Estimated supplier size (optional but adds realism)

**Risk Score Distribution Strategy:** Don't make all suppliers low-risk! Real procurement has:

* 70% low risk (score 0-30): Established, reliable vendors
* 20% medium risk (score 31-70): Some payment issues or quality concerns
* 10% high risk (score 71-100): New vendors, poor track record, or volatile markets

**Category Distribution:** Not all categories are equal. Consider:

* IT Services: Typically higher spend per PO (enterprise software, cloud services)
* Marketing Agencies: Medium spend, project-based
* Office Supplies: Low spend per PO but high frequency
* Logistics: Medium-high spend, critical for operations
* Manufacturing: Highest spend for physical goods production

**Naming Strategy:** Use `Faker.company()` but enhance it:

```
# Don't just use fake.company() directly
base_name = fake.company()
# Add industry-specific suffixes
if category == "IT Services":
    name = f"{base_name} Technologies" or f"{base_name} Solutions"
elif category == "Marketing Agency":
    name = f"{base_name} Marketing" or f"{base_name} Creative"
```

This makes supplier names feel authentic to their industry.

**Geographic Distribution:**

* 60% domestic
* 30% nearshore
* 10% offshore

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `data/processed/procurement/suppliers.csv` with 150 realistic suppliers

**Part 2: Purchase Order Generation**

POs are the heart of procurement. Each PO represents a company buying something from a supplier.

**Attributes to Generate:**

* `id`: Unique identifier (format: `PO-2024-0001` to `PO-2024-0200`)
* `supplier_id`: Foreign key to suppliers table
* `amount`: Dollar amount ($500 to $150,000)
* `date`: When PO was issued (past 12 months)
* `status`: Current state (approved, pending, completed, cancelled)
* `category`: What's being purchased (matches supplier category)
* `campaign_id`: Link to marketing campaigns (30% of POs should have this for cross-domain joins)
* `description`: Brief text of what's being purchased (optional but useful for NER training)

**Amount Distribution - Critical Decision:** PO amounts are NOT uniformly distributed! In real procurement:

* Most POs are small: Office supplies, minor services
* Some POs are medium: Project work, monthly retainers
* Few POs are large: Major software licenses, equipment

Use log-normal distribution:

```
# Log-normal creates realistic long-tail distribution
amounts = np.random.lognormal(mean=10, sigma=1.5, size=200)
amounts = amounts * 1000  # Scale to dollars
amounts = np.clip(amounts, 500, 150000)  # Set min/max bounds
```

**Supplier-PO Relationships:** Not every supplier gets the same number of POs:

* 20% of suppliers get 50% of POs (high-volume vendors)
* 50% of suppliers get 40% of POs (regular vendors)
* 30% of suppliers get 10% of POs (occasional vendors)

**Status Distribution:**

* 75% completed: PO fulfilled and closed
* 15% approved: PO active, goods/services being delivered
* 7% pending: PO awaiting approval
* 3% cancelled: PO was cancelled before fulfillment

**Campaign Linkage (CRITICAL for cross-domain joins):** About 30% of POs should be linked to marketing campaigns via `campaign_id`. This enables questions like "How much did we spend on suppliers for the Spring Launch campaign?"

To do this, you'll need campaign IDs from Seonyoung. Coordinate with her to get the list of 30 campaign IDs, then randomly assign ~60 of your POs to campaigns.

**Temporal Patterns:** Don't make PO dates completely random! Consider:

* Q4 spike: More spending in October-December (end of fiscal year)
* Month-end clustering: More POs issued at month-end (budget cycles)
* Weekday bias: 95% of POs on weekdays, 5% on weekends

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `data/processed/procurement/pos.csv` with 200 realistic POs

**Part 3: Invoice Generation**

Invoices are supplier bills requesting payment for completed POs.

**Attributes to Generate:**

* `id`: Unique identifier (format: `INV-0001` to `INV-0180`)
* `po_id`: Foreign key to POs table (each invoice belongs to one PO)
* `amount`: Dollar amount (usually matches PO, sometimes slightly different)
* `issue_date`: When invoice was sent
* `due_date`: When payment is due (based on supplier payment terms)
* `paid_date`: When actually paid (NULL if unpaid)
* `status`: Current state (paid, pending, overdue)

**Key Relationships:**

* 90% of completed POs should have invoices (180 invoices for ~200 completed POs)
* Invoice `amount` usually matches PO `amount`, but allow 5-10% variance (change orders, taxes, shipping)
* Invoice `issue_date` should be after PO `date` (can't invoice before ordering!)

**Payment Status Realism:**

* 80% paid on time: `paid_date` ≤ `due_date`
* 15% paid late: `paid_date` > `due_date` by 1-30 days
* 5% overdue: `paid_date` is NULL and today > `due_date`

**Due Date Calculation:**

```
# Due date depends on supplier payment terms
if supplier.payment_terms == "Net 30":
    due_date = issue_date + timedelta(days=30)
elif supplier.payment_terms == "Net 60":
    due_date = issue_date + timedelta(days=60)
```

**Payment Behavior Correlation with Risk:** High-risk suppliers might receive late payments more often:

* Low risk suppliers: 90% on-time payment rate
* Medium risk suppliers: 75% on-time payment rate
* High risk suppliers: 60% on-time payment rate

**Acceptance Criteria**

* `data/processed/procurement/invoices.csv` with 180 realistic invoices

**Part 4: Dictionary Creation for Entity Linking (30 minutes)**

Yixuan needs dictionaries to link extracted entities to your canonical IDs.

Create `data/dictionaries/procurement/suppliers.json`:

```
[
  {
    "id": "SUP_001",
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "aliases": [
      "Acme Corp",
      "ACME",
      "Acme Inc",
      "Acme International"
    ],
    "category": "IT Services"
  },
  ...
]
```

Include aliases for:

* Common abbreviations ("Corp" vs "Corporation")
* With/without legal suffixes ("Inc", "LLC", "Ltd")
* Acronyms if applicable
* Common misspellings (optional but helpful)

Similarly create dictionaries for:

* `pos.json`: List of all PO IDs with metadata
* `contracts.json`: If you generate contract data

**Validation Script:** Create `etl/validate_procurement_data.py` that checks:

* No duplicate IDs
* All foreign keys valid (every `po.supplier_id` exists in suppliers)
* Date logic valid (invoice_date > po_date)
* Amounts are positive
* Status values are from allowed set
* No orphan records

**Acceptance Criteria**

* 150 suppliers with realistic names and distributions
* Risk score distribution: 70% low, 20% medium, 10% high
* 200 POs with log-normal amount distribution
* ~60 POs linked to campaigns (coordinate with Seonyoung)
* 180 invoices with realistic payment patterns
* 80% on-time payment rate overall
* Dictionaries created in JSON format
* Validation script passes all checks
* CSV files load correctly in pandas
* Documentation of data generation process

**Data Model Documentation**

Create `ontologies/joins_sprint2.md` with comprehensive documentation.

**Document Structure:**

```

## Graph Schema Diagram


## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Campaign, Multiple Suppliers
**Campaign:** "Spring Launch 2024"
**Budget:** $100,000
**Procurement:**
- PO-001 → Advertising Agency ($50,000)
- PO-002 → Facebook Ads ($30,000)
- PO-003 → Event Venue ($15,000)
- PO-004 → Photographer ($5,000)

Graph:
```

(Campaign: Spring Launch) -[:FUNDED_BY]-> (PO-001) -[:BILLED_BY]-> (Supplier: Creative Agency)
(Campaign: Spring Launch) -[:FUNDED_BY]-> (PO-002) -[:BILLED_BY]-> (Supplier: Meta)
(Campaign: Spring Launch) -[:FUNDED_BY]-> (PO-003) -[:BILLED_BY]-> (Supplier: Event Co)
(Campaign: Spring Launch) -[:FUNDED_BY]-> (PO-004) -[:BILLED_BY]-> (Supplier: PhotoPro)

```

### Scenario 2: Shared Service, Multiple Campaigns

## Cypher Query Examples

### Query 1: Find all suppliers funding a specific campaign
```cypher
MATCH (c:Campaign {id: 'CAMP_2024_Q1'})-[:FUNDED_BY]->(po:PO)-[:BILLED_BY]->(s:Supplier)
RETURN s.name, sum(po.amount) AS total_spend
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
```

### Query 2: Calculate total procurement cost per campaign

### Query 3: Find high-ROI campaigns and their suppliers

### Query 4: Identify high-risk spend

## Implementation Notes

### For Graph Construction (ETL)

## Questions & Decisions Log

## Coordination Points

### With Seonyoung (Marketing Data Owner)

- **Need:** List of 30 campaign IDs with budgets
- **Provide:** PO IDs that can be linked to campaigns
- **Sync:** Mid-week check-in to ensure IDs align

### With Yixuan (API Developer)

#### Set Up RAG Environment & Gemini API

## **Context & Goal**

You're setting up the foundation for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This is your first step into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. By the end of this task, you'll have a working connection to Google's Gemini AI and understand how to configure it for the HelixGraph RAG use case.

RAG is what makes HelixGraph "intelligent." Instead of users writing complex Cypher queries, they can ask natural language questions like "What campaigns is Acme Corp funding?" Your RAG system will:

1. Extract entities from the question (using Yixuan's NER)
1. Retrieve relevant context from the graph (using your context retriever)
1. Generate a natural language answer (using Gemini)

**Why Google Gemini?**

For this project, we're using Google's Gemini API for several reasons:

**Advantages:**

* **Free tier**
* **Long context window**
* **Fast responses**
* **No credit card required**
* **Good enough quality**

**Detailed Requirements:**

**Part 1: Get Gemini API Key (30 minutes)**

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Go to Google AI Studio**
   * Visit: [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)
   * Click "Get started" or "Get API key in Google AI Studio"
1. **Sign in with Google Account**
   * Use your personal or school Gmail account
   * No payment method required!
1. **Accept Terms**
   * Read and accept Google's AI terms of service
   * Confirm you're not using it for harmful purposes
1. **Create API Key**
   * Click "Get API key" button
   * Choose "Create API key in new project" (recommended)
   * Or select existing Google Cloud project if you have one
   * Click "Create API key"
1. **Copy and Store Key Safely**
   * Key looks like: `AIzaSyA...` (40 characters)
   * **CRITICAL:** Never commit this to Git!
   * **CRITICAL:** Never share publicly!
   * Store in password manager or secure note

**Testing the API Key:**

```

from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents="Explain how AI works in a few words",
)

print(response.text)

# Expected output: "Hello! I'm working and ready to help. How can I assist you today?"

```

If you see output, success! If error, check:

* API key is correct (40 characters)
* No extra spaces or quotes
* Internet connection working
* Google AI Studio says key is "Active"

**Install Dependencies & Setup**

**Install Required Packages:**

```

# Core RAG dependencies

pip install google-generativeai==0.3.2  # Gemini SDK
pip install jinja2==3.1.2                # Prompt templating
pip install python-dotenv==1.0.0         # Environment variable management

# Already installed (verify):

pip install neo4j==5.14.1                # Neo4j driver
pip install pandas==2.1.3                # Data manipulation

```

**Create Directory Structure:**

```

cd /path/to/helixgraph

# Create RAG directory structure

mkdir -p rag/{templates,examples,tests}

# Create necessary files

touch rag/__init__.py
touch rag/config.py
touch rag/helix_rag.py
touch rag/context_retriever.py
touch rag/test_connections.py

```

**Your RAG directory should look like:**
```

rag/
├── __init__.py              # Makes it a Python package
├── config.py                # Configuration management

```

**Create Configuration Management**

**Create **`rag/config.py`:

This file centralizes all RAG configuration in one place. Good configuration management is crucial for:

* Security (keeping secrets out of code)
* Flexibility (easy to change settings)
* Different environments (dev, staging, production)

```

## Build Graph Context Retriever

**Context & Goal**

The context retriever is the "knowledge" part of your RAG system. When a user asks "What campaigns is Acme Corp funding?", this component queries Neo4j to gather all relevant information about Acme Corp—their POs, campaigns, risk score, payment history, etc.—and formats it into text that Gemini can understand.

**Requirements:**

Create `rag/context_retriever.py` with a `GraphContextRetriever` class that:

* Connects to Neo4j using your config
* Implements 3 context functions: `get_supplier_context()`, `get_campaign_context()`, `get_product_context()`
* Retrieves graph neighborhood (2 hops deep)
* Formats results as human-readable text (not JSON)
* Handles missing entities gracefully
* Includes aggregations (total spend, counts, averages)

**Context Retrieval Strategy:**

For each entity type, gather:

**Supplier Context Should Include:**

* Basic info: name, category, risk score, country
* Procurement metrics: total POs, total spend, average PO size
* Campaign relationships: which campaigns they fund
* Risk indicators: overdue invoices, payment history
* Active contracts

**Example Output Format:**

```

Supplier: Acme Corporation
Category: IT Services
Risk Score: 25 (Low Risk)
Country: United States
Total Spend: $125,000 across 8 POs
Average PO Size: $15,625
Payment History: 7 on-time, 1 late payment (10 days)
Active Campaigns: Spring Launch 2024, Q4 Initiative, Summer Sale
Contracts: CT-2024-05 (active until Dec 31, 2024)
Recent Activity: Last PO issued 15 days ago

```

**Testing Your Context Retriever:**

Create `rag/test_context.py`

**Create Jinja2 Prompt Templates**

Create `rag/templates/supplier.j2`

**Why Jinja2 Templates?**

* Separates prompt logic from code (easier to modify)
* Allows variable substitution: `{{ context }}`, `{{ question }}`
* Can include conditionals: `{% if context %}`
* Industry standard for templating

**Create templates for each entity type:**

* `supplier.j2` - For supplier questions
* `campaign.j2` - For campaign questions
* `product.j2` - For product questions

**Implement HelixRAG Class**

Create `rag/helix_rag.py` and create `rag/test_rag.py` for testing the HelixRAG. 

**Acceptance Criteria**

* HelixRAG class implemented with all methods
* 3 Jinja2 templates created and working
* Integration with Yixuan's entity extraction works
* Integration with your context retriever works
* Gemini API calls succeed
* Answers 8/10 test questions correctly
* Response time < 5 seconds
* Error handling for all edge cases

## Create RAG API endpoint

**Context & Goal**

A REST API endpoint that exposes your RAG system to the frontend (Seonyoung's Streamlit app). This endpoint accepts natural language questions, processes them through RAG, and returns structured answers.

**Requirements:**

Create `api/endpoints/rag.py`

Add to `api/main.py`

Test with curl.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* RAG endpoint at `POST /api/v1/rag/ask`
* Request/response models defined with Pydantic
* Auto entity extraction when not provided
* Proper error handling (400, 500)
* Execution time tracking
* OpenAPI docs updated
* Tested with 10 different questions

## Build ETL Pipeline for Graph Construction

**Context & Goal**

A comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that loads all Sprint 2 data into Neo4j. This creates the actual knowledge graph that powers queries and RAG.

**Requirements:**

Create `etl/load_sprint2.py` and run it. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* All data loaded without errors
* Graph contains ≥3,500 nodes
* All relationships created
* No orphan nodes
* Validation checks pass
* Loading time < 5 minutes

## Document RAG Implementation

**Context & Goal**

Create comprehensive documentation in `docs/rag_architecture.md`.

**Acceptance Criteria**

* Architecture diagram included
* 10 example Q&A pairs documented
* Known limitations listed
* Troubleshooting guide complete
```
